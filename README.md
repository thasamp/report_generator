# report_generator
This Python application integrates with Excel to automate the task of generating reports.

Version 1 doesn't require an Excel sheet to work. You must type all information into the boxes.

Version 2 requires an Excel sheet to work and is configured for use on my own machine. I am currently unable to provide the base sheet, but I am working on it :)
